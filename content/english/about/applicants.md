    "<b>Q. What We Expect for Ph.D. Students?</b>

    1. **Strong Motivation**. Enjoy conducting research in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Interactive System Design, UX, and Digital-Physical Convergence. 
    
    2. **Proactive Initiative**. In grad school, nobody will tell you exactly what to do next. You need to be able to take the initiative and try things without being told.

    3. **At least two publications in top-tier journals or conferences** (e.g., CHI, International Journal of HCI, TOCHI, or similar venues). This reflects our lab’s focus on contributing impactful and high-quality research to the global academic community.

    4. **Not being afraid to dive into the implementation and design of new systems.** While hands-on development skills are preferred, they are not a strict requirement. What matters most is your willingness to learn and grow. To support this, we provide access to online learning resources and guidance to help you acquire the necessary skills.

    5. **Communication Skills**. Communication skills can be learnt during the PhD, but you need to start out willing to share and learn. If you are extremely shy/do not talk up, it will not matter how smart you are or how great your work is.
