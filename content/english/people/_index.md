  content : "Hi. I am an **Interaction Design / HCI** researcher. I am an Assistant Professor at Yonsei University, Underwood International Colleage, Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (HASS) Division. Under HASS, I am leading a **Convergence Design Lab** and envisions the future of our new reality in this Digial-Physical convergence era. Previously, I worked as a Senior Designer at Samsung Research HQ, Korea; and before that, I worked as a Senior Research Scientist at Autodesk Research, Toronto. I received my PhD in Industrial Design (Human-Computer Interaction + Design) from ID KAIST, where I was working on embodied design tools for everyday designers.


  My research lies at the intersection of **Human-Computer Interaction** and **Interactive System Designs**. My vision is to design comfortable and novel experiences for an immersive, interactive, and simulated virtual world at a shared, with a multi-disciplinary approach. I envision the potential **interactions for future technologies (VR/AR/AI)** with a goal of enhancing our convergnece experiences. During my Ph.D., I explored embodied interactions for VR/AR digital design tools. I enjoy creating and applying new user-centered design methods, as well as prototyping interactive systems."
