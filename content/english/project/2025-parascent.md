metacontent: "We introduce Ponify, a sonification method that translates a painting’s sense of dynamics into music through pose analysis. Ponify analyzes the limb movements of human figures in paintings and configures musical parameters such as the tempo and density to convey dynamic perceptions."

summary: "In digital spaces, people often struggle to intuitively grasp the qualities of a perfume—text descriptions can be long and tedious, underscoring the need for more visual and instantly understandable representations. To address this gap, we investigated a parametric visualization toolkit for communicating perfume qualities without the actual scent. A formative study explored which visual elements might best represent attributes, revealing commonly nominated features such as layers, stroke thickness, and curvature, and highlighting motion as a promising cue for dynamic characteristics. Building on these insights, we developed ParaScent, a toolkit that encodes perfume attributes into motion-enhanced visuals. In a user evaluation, ParaScent improved interpretation, stimulated curiosity, and increased confidence in scent selection compared to conventional static, chart-based visualizations. These findings point to the potential of motion-driven, multi-parameter representations as an engaging, accessible, and effective way to communicate scent in digital contexts."
